## Breaking Changes in Terraform provider

## Version Compatibilities

Our releases follow the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) convention to ensure predictability and stability. Each version is represented as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where:

- MAJOR version updates may contain breaking changes.
- MINOR version updates introduce backward-compatible functionality and can contain breaking changes 
- PATCH version updates encompass backward-compatible bug fixes.

## Release Support Period

Every release of the Atlas Terraform Provider is officially supported for approximately one year from its initial release date.
Each version of the provider is guaranteed to function properly for that time period.
We strongly recommend updating to the latest versions of the provider for the latest features and bug fixes. 

## Non-Breaking Changes Assurance

Minor and patch releases might contain new features that will affect users' workflow but generally would not contain any breaking changes. 
Users will be notified by release notes about breaking changes in the provider.

## Upgrading

1. Before upgrading, carefully review the release notes for any breaking changes.
3. If you encounter problems please create a github issue.
